Easily provide shipping estimates for your customers based on their postal code.

== Description ==

Fraktvalg lets you easily combine your preferred shipping partners in one place, and reducing the need for continuous plugin updates to access new providers, or be compatible with your existing ones if their technical integration changes over time.

Fraktvalg is a SaaS solution, and requires an API key to function, which you can obtain by signing up at [Fraktvalg](https://fraktvalg.no/).

**Privacy note**
Although the plugin does not directly store user data, in order to calculate shipping costs it will need to send order data such as items (weight, sizes, and types), your shop address, and the customers delivery address to the Fraktvalg API services, which handles the communication with the individual shipping providers.

You may also find additional privacy details in your WordPress admin area under the Tools > Privacy menu.
