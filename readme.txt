**How It Works:**

Fraktvalg operates as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution, requiring an API key obtainable by signing up at Fraktvalg. Once integrated, the plugin calculates shipping costs in real-time by sending order details—such as item weight, sizes, your shop address, and the customer's delivery address—to the Fraktvalg API. This process ensures accurate communication with each shipping provider, delivering precise rates and options at checkout.​

**Privacy information:**

While the plugin does not directly store user data, it transmits necessary order information to the Fraktvalg API to calculate shipping costs accurately. This includes product details and delivery addresses. For comprehensive information on data handling and protection, please review the [Fraktvalg Privacy Policy](https://api.fraktvalg.no/personvern).
